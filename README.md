# MuStar Summer Project 

## Description
This is a summer project that I am working on with gradute student Johnny Esteves 
at the University of Michigan within the group organized by Professor Marcelle Soares-Santos 
## Main Goal
In short, the goal of the project is to define the scalar mass relations between MuStar and the masses of galaxy clusters
from data samples selected by the South Pole Telescope (SPT).
## Main List of Questions
- 1. Which observable (mass proximity) has the lowest scattering within our measurements?
- 2. Is MuStar robust against systematic effects (miscentering, projection, & orientation)?
- 3. Does the inclusion and analysis of blue-shifted galaxies help decrease scattering within our measurements?
